## Update 11/25

I didn't see your code until just now but I actually was able to finish what we need for the demo. I saved in project.mlx. You can use the images I have uploaded to see it.

We still need to do the dataset / experimental part I think, but it shouldn't be too bad. I will email you with my phone number so we can communicate that way. May want to do a zoom call soon or somehting.

## Update 11/27

I have the completed experiment and the updated demo live scripts uploaded. To run the experiment, download and extract the original.zip dataset and place the folder in the project's root. Then you just need to run the experiment.mlx file in matlab to see the results. After running through 1000 pairs of images, the Average Euclidean Distance was about 21 pixels, which seems good enough to me.
