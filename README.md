## Update 11/25

I didn't see your code until just now but I actually was able to finish what we need for the demo. I saved in project.mlx. You can use the images I have uploaded to see it.

We still need to do the dataset / experimental part I think, but it shouldn't be too bad. I will email you with my phone number so we can communicate that way. May want to do a zoom call soon or somehting.
